# reddit-scraper

## About
This scraper was created to scrape posts and their comments from subreddits as part of a research project I worked on under Hayeong Song. It makes use of the PRAW API.

## Usage
To run this scraper, make sure to first go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps and create your own app. Then find the client id, client secret, and user agent and replace this information on line 6 using your personal IDs that you just obtained. See https://www.honchosearch.com/blog/seo/how-to-use-praw-and-crawl-reddit-for-subreddit-post-data/ for more information

## Run
To run the scraper, make sure you have python installed on your computer and run ``` python scraper.py ``` through terminal or command prompt in the same directory as the scraper.
